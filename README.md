Tiny Arch
---------

Tiny Arch generates a 10M bootable iso to run pacman from initramfs.

The system generate by Tiny Arch is minimal, it is configured to have the bare
minimum drivers and mostly busybox commands.

# Use

Just run `tinyarch container` and it will create the iso for you, to run the
iso using qemu use the following command:

```sh
qemu-system-x86_64 -device virtio-net,netdev=network0 -netdev user,id=network0 -boot order=d -cdrom tinyarch.iso
```

# Configuration

To add new files, binaries or modules into the iso you need to:

- Install the aditional package with `tinyarch container {packages}`.
- Change `FILES` parameter in the Tiny Arch mkinitcpio configuration to copy
  the files.
- Modules can be added with the `MODULES` parameter.

# How it works

The script will create a base system in /temp, and run itself inside this
container using `systemd-nspawn` to create a bootable iso. The iso uses the
syslinux bootloader, arch's stock kernel, a clean filesystem, and a initramfs
with a basic system to run pacman.

## Boot

Tiny Arch generates an iso image using xorriso, xorriso suports el torito for
setting up the boot loader. The image generated by Tiny Arch will use syslinux
as it bootload.
